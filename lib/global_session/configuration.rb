module GlobalSession
  # Central point of access for GlobalSession configuration information. This is
  # mostly a very thin wrapper around the serialized hash written to the YAML config
  # file.
  #
  # The configuration is stored as a set of nested hashes and accessed by the code
  # using hash lookup; for example, we might ask for +Configuration['cookie']['domain']+
  # if we wanted to know which domain the cookie should be set for.
  #
  # The following settings are supported:
  # * attributes
  #    * signed
  #    * insecure
  # * integrated
  # * ephemeral
  # * timeout
  # * renew
  # * authority
  # * trust
  # * directory
  # * cookie
  #     * name
  #     * domain
  #
  # === Config Environments
  # The operational environment of global_session defines which section
  # of the configuration file it gets its settings from. When used with
  # a web app, the environment should be set to the same environment as
  # the web app. (If using Rails integration, this happens for you
  # automatically.)
  #
  # === Environment-Specific Settings
  # The top level of keys in the configuration hash are special; they provide different
  # sections of settings that apply in different environments. For instance, a Rails
  # application might have one set of settings that apply in the development environment;
  # these would appear under +Configuration['development']+. Another set of settings would
  # apply in the production environment and would appear under +Configuration['production']+.
  #
  # === Common Settings
  # In addition to having one section for each operating environment, the configuration
  # file can specify a 'common' section for settings that apply
  #
  # === Lookup Mechanism
  # When the code asks for +Configuration['foo']+, we first check whether the current
  # environment's config section has a value for foo. If one is found, we return that.
  #
  # If no environment-specific setting is found, we check the 'common' section and return
  # the value found there.
  #
  # === Config File Location
  # The name and location of the config file depend on the Web framework with which
  # you are integrating; see GlobalSession::Rails for more information.
  #
  class Configuration
    # @return a representation of the object suitable for printing to the console

    #
    # === Parameters
    # config(String|Hash):: Absolute filesystem path to the configuration file, or Hash containing configuration
    # environment(String):: Config file section from which to read settings
