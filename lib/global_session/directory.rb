module GlobalSession
  # The global session directory, which provides some lookup and decision services
  # to instances of Session.
  #
  # The default implementation is simplistic, but should be suitable for most applications.
  # Directory is designed to be specialized via subclassing. To override the behavior to
  # suit your needs, simply create a subclass of Directory and add a configuration file
  # setting to specify the class name of your implementation:  
  #
  #     common:
  #       directory: MyCoolDirectory
  #
  #
  # === The Authority Keystore
  # Directory uses a filesystem directory as a backing store for RSA
  # public keys of global session authorities. The directory should
  # contain one or more +*.pub+ files containing OpenSSH-format public
  # RSA keys. The name of the pub file determines the name of the
  # authority it represents.
  #
  # === The Local Authority
  # Directory will infer the name of the local authority (if any) by
  # looking for a private-key file in the keystore. If a +*.key+ file
  # is found, then its name is taken to be the name of the local
  # authority and all GlobalSessions created will be signed by that
  # authority's private key.
  #
  # If more than one key file is found, Directory will raise an error
  # at initialization time.
  #
