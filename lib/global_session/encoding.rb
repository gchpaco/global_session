      # === Parameters
      # json(String):: A well-formed JSON document
      #
      # === Return
      # value(Hash):: An unserialized Ruby Hash

      # === Parameters
      # value(Hash):: The hash to be serialized

      # === Return
      # json(String):: A JSON-serialized representation of +value+

    # Implements URL encoding, but without newlines, and using '-' and '_' as
    # the 62nd and 63rd symbol instead of '+' and '/'. This makes for encoded
    # values that can be easily stored in a cookie; however, they cannot
    # be used in a URL query string without URL-escaping them since they
    # will contain '=' characters.
    #
    # This scheme is almost identical to the scheme "Base 64 Encoding with URL
    # and Filename Safe Alphabet," described in RFC4648, with the exception that
    # this scheme preserves the '=' padding characters due to limitations of
    # Ruby's built-in base64 encoding routines.

      # === Parameters
      # encoded(String):: The encoded string

      # === Return
      # decoded(String):: The decoded result, which may contain nonprintable bytes

      #
      # === Parameters
      # decoded(String):: The raw string to be encoded

      # === Return
      # encoded(String):: The B64cookie-encoded result.
